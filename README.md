# KidzApp
And education Game for your toddler!

# Description
*Kidz-App* This educational game teaches your toddler sensory, language, and social skills. There are two types of games, one with animals and one with shapes. After one of the two games is selected, a friendly voice asks the child to find a given animal or shape. After each correct guess the page refreshes with a new set of answer choices and prompts. For incorrect guesses, another prompt encourages kids to keep trying. 

The overall interface is colorful, responsive, and easy to use on an tablet, so parents can let their toddler play with minimal assistance. 

Parents can also track their child’s learning progress with a special menu option that graphs each child's progress. The data points are securely stored in a MySQL database and tied to each parent’s unique user name and password, which are required to start each game. These data are abstracted via the Sequelize library before they’re rendered for parents in the easy-to-read “parent-mode” menu.
